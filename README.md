## Project setup
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Deploying to server
In order to have urls that are directly entered in the browser work properly, some server configuration is required. 
if not, everything except `/` will throw a 404 error as this is a single page application.

See [History mode](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html) in the Vue documentation.

## Project improvements

### Lazy-load routes
See [Lazy loading](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html) in the Vue documentation.
